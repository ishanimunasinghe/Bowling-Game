# Bowling-Game

This is an object-oriented program that is played in the terminal using text-based user input. 

The user selects a level; easy, medium and hard. The level determines the likelihood of the player bowling a higher number. The algorithm works by randomly generating three numbers and using a bubble sort to arrange them in ascending order. The level corresponds to which number is selected as the number of pins the player knocks down - level easy corresponds to the highest random number while level hard corresponds to the lowest random number. Using three numbers allows for a more accurate level algorithm (ie. they are more likely to bowl a lower, middle or higher number).
